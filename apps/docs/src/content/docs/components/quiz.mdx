import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Quiz** component (`ui:quiz`) renders interactive assessments with per-question feedback, score tracking, and optional explanations. It supports three question types: multiple-choice (radio buttons), true/false, and multi-select (checkboxes).

## Examples

  - type: multiple-choice

    options:

    answer: 1
    explanation: The "let" keyword declares a block-scoped local variable.

## Accessibility

- Each question group uses `role="group"` with an `aria-label` indicating the question number.
- Multiple-choice and true/false questions use `role="radiogroup"` with radio buttons.
- Multi-select questions use checkboxes with `role="checkbox"`.
- Feedback messages (correct/incorrect) and explanations are inside an `aria-live="polite"` region so screen readers announce results.
- The outer container uses `role="region"` with `aria-label` set to the quiz title (or "Quiz" if no title is provided).
- Submit buttons are disabled until a selection is made, preventing empty submissions.
