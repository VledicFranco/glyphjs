description: An overview of all built-in Glyph JS UI components.
---

Glyph JS ships with **21 built-in UI components** that transform YAML payloads inside fenced code blocks into rich, interactive visualizations. Each component has a Zod schema that validates its YAML at compile time, producing clear diagnostics if anything is wrong.

## Authoring syntax

All components use the same fenced-code-block pattern. Write a fenced code block whose info string is `ui:` followed by the component name, and place valid YAML inside:

````markdown
```ui:callout
type: info
content: This is an informational callout.
```
````

The YAML inside the block is parsed and validated by `@glyphjs/compiler` against the component Zod schema defined in `@glyphjs/schemas`.

| [Architecture](/glyphjs/components/architecture/) | `ui:architecture` | System architecture diagrams with grouped nodes and connections. |
| [FileTree](/glyphjs/components/filetree/) | `ui:filetree` | Interactive file and directory tree views. |

### Narrative & Interactive

| Component | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Timeline](/glyphjs/components/timeline/) | `ui:timeline` | Chronological event sequences on a visual timeline. |
| [Infographic](/glyphjs/components/infographic/) | `ui:infographic` | Multi-section visual infographics with icons and stats. |
| [Equation](/glyphjs/components/equation/) | `ui:equation` | Step-by-step mathematical equations with annotations. |
| [Quiz](/glyphjs/components/quiz/) | `ui:quiz` | Interactive quizzes with multiple-choice questions and feedback. |

## Reserved YAML keys

Two top-level YAML keys are reserved and processed by the compiler before schema validation:

- **`glyph-id`** -- An explicit, user-assigned block ID that overrides the auto-generated ID. Enables stable cross-block references.
- **`refs`** -- An array of reference objects (`{ target, type, label }`) that declare relationships between blocks.

These keys are stripped from the component data before it reaches the component schema.

## Container components

`ui:tabs` and `ui:steps` are **container components** whose children are expressed as Markdown strings inside the YAML `content` fields. The compiler re-parses each `content` field recursively, producing child `Block[]` entries in the IR. This allows tabs and steps to contain rich Markdown (paragraphs, lists, code blocks) but not nested `ui:` components in v1.
