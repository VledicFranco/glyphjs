description: Present chronological events on a visual timeline.
---

The **Timeline** component (`ui:timeline`) renders a sequence of chronological events on a visual timeline. Each event has a date, title, and optional description and type. The timeline can be oriented vertically or horizontally.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `events` | `Event[]` | Yes | -- | An array of event objects to display on the timeline. |
| `orientation` | `"vertical" \| "horizontal"` | No | -- | Layout direction of the timeline. |

### Event object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `date` | `string` | Yes | -- | The date or datetime string for the event (e.g. "2026-01-15", "Q1 2026"). |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | -- | The heading text for the event. |
| `description` | `string` | No | -- | Additional detail text shown beneath the title. |
| `type` | `string` | No | -- | A semantic type used for color-coding and grouping (e.g. "release", "milestone", "breaking-change"). |

## Orientation

- **vertical** -- Events are stacked top-to-bottom with dates on the left and content on the right. Best for long timelines and mobile layouts.
- **horizontal** -- Events are arranged left-to-right along a horizontal axis. Best for short timelines and wide viewports.

When `orientation` is omitted, the renderer chooses a default based on the viewport and number of events.

## Example

### Horizontal timeline

````markdown

    title: Alpha
    type: release
  - date: Q2 2026

```

## Event types

The `type` field is a free-form string that controls the visual style of the event marker. While any string is accepted, the following conventions are recommended:

| Type | Suggested use |
|---|---|
| `release` | Software releases and version launches. |
| `milestone` | Major project milestones and deadlines. |
| `breaking-change` | Backward-incompatible changes. |
| `deprecation` | Feature deprecation notices. |
| `event` | General events. |

Custom type strings receive a default neutral style.

## Accessibility

- The timeline renders as a semantic ordered list (`<ol>`) with each event as a list item.
- Dates are wrapped in `<time>` elements with machine-readable `datetime` attributes when the date string is ISO 8601 compatible.
- Event markers are decorative and hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
- The timeline orientation does not affect the reading order -- events are always announced in chronological order.
