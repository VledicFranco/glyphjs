description: Present chronological events on a visual timeline.

import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Timeline** component (`ui:timeline`) renders a sequence of chronological events on a visual timeline. Each event has a date, title, and optional description and type. The timeline can be oriented vertically or horizontally.

## Example

export const verticalExample = `\`\`\`ui:timeline
events:
  - date: "2026-01-15"
    title: Project kickoff
    description: Initial RFC published and repository created.
    type: milestone
  - date: "2026-01-22"
    title: Parser v0.1
    description: "First working remark plugin for ui: fenced blocks."
    type: release
  - date: "2026-01-29"
    title: Compiler v0.1
    description: Schema validation and IR generation complete.
    type: release
  - date: "2026-02-05"
    title: Runtime v0.1
    description: React rendering of all 8 built-in components.
    type: release
  - date: "2026-02-12"
    title: Public beta
    description: First public release with documentation and playground.
    type: milestone
orientation: vertical

### Timeline with varied event types

Use different `type` values to color-code events by category. This helps readers quickly scan for specific types of events.

export const typedEventsExample = `\`\`\`ui:timeline
events:
  - date: "2025-03-01"
    title: v1.0 Release
    description: Initial stable release with core API.
    type: release
  - date: "2025-04-15"
    title: v1.1 Release
    description: Added new chart components and themes.
    type: release
  - date: "2025-05-01"
    title: Performance milestone
    description: Achieved sub-100ms render time for complex diagrams.
    type: milestone
  - date: "2025-06-01"
    title: Deprecated legacy API
    description: Old render() function marked deprecated.
    type: deprecation
  - date: "2025-07-01"
    title: v2.0 Breaking Changes
    description: New component API, removed legacy render function.
    type: breaking-change

### Horizontal roadmap timeline

Horizontal timelines work well for high-level roadmaps with fewer events.

export const roadmapExample = `\`\`\`ui:timeline
events:
  - date: Q1 2026
    title: Research
    description: User research and technical feasibility.
    type: milestone
  - date: Q2 2026
    title: Alpha
    description: Internal testing with core features.
    type: release
  - date: Q3 2026
    title: Beta
    description: Public beta with documentation.
    type: release
  - date: Q4 2026
    title: GA Release
    description: General availability with SLA.
    type: milestone
orientation: horizontal
\`\`\``;

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `events` | `Event[]` | Yes | -- | An array of event objects to display on the timeline. |
| `orientation` | `"vertical" \| "horizontal"` | No | -- | Layout direction of the timeline. |
| `markdown` | `boolean` | No | `false` | Enable inline markdown formatting in event `title` and `description` fields. |

### Event object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `date` | `string` | Yes | -- | The date or datetime string for the event (e.g. "2026-01-15", "Q1 2026"). |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | -- | The heading text for the event. |
| `description` | `string` | No | -- | Additional detail text shown beneath the title. |
| `type` | `string` | No | -- | A semantic type used for color-coding and grouping (e.g. "release", "milestone", "breaking-change"). |

## Markdown Support

Enable inline markdown in timeline events:

```md
```ui:timeline
events:
  - date: "2024-01-15"
    title: "Version **2.0** Released"
    description: "Check out the [release notes](https://example.com) for all the new features."
  - date: "2024-02-01"
    title: "New `renderToString` API"
    description: "Server-side rendering is now *fully supported*."
markdown: true
```
```

Supported formatting: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, [links](url)

[Learn more about markdown in components →](../guides/component-markdown)

## Orientation

- **vertical** -- Events are stacked top-to-bottom with dates on the left and content on the right. Best for long timelines and mobile layouts.
- **horizontal** -- Events are arranged left-to-right along a horizontal axis. Best for short timelines and wide viewports.

When `orientation` is omitted, the renderer chooses a default based on the viewport and number of events.

## Event types

The `type` field is a free-form string that controls the visual style of the event marker. While any string is accepted, the following conventions are recommended:

| Type | Suggested use |
|---|---|
| `release` | Software releases and version launches. |
| `milestone` | Major project milestones and deadlines. |
| `breaking-change` | Backward-incompatible changes. |
| `deprecation` | Feature deprecation notices. |
| `event` | General events. |

Custom type strings receive a default neutral style.

## Accessibility

- The timeline renders as a semantic ordered list (`<ol>`) with each event as a list item.
- Dates are wrapped in `<time>` elements with machine-readable `datetime` attributes when the date string is ISO 8601 compatible.
- Event markers are decorative and hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
- The timeline orientation does not affect the reading order -- events are always announced in chronological order.
