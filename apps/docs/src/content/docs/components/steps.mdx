import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Steps** component (`ui:steps`) renders a numbered, vertical step list with optional progress indication. Each step has a title, an optional status, and rich Markdown content. Steps are a **container component** -- the compiler re-parses each step's `content` field recursively.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `steps` | `Step[]` | Yes | -- | An array of step objects. Must contain at least one step. |

### Step object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `string` | Yes | -- | The heading text for this step. |
| `status` | `"pending" \| "active" \| "completed"` | No | -- | Visual indicator of the step's progress state. |
| `content` | `string` | Yes | -- | Markdown content rendered inside the step body. Parsed recursively by the compiler. |

## Status variants

- **pending** -- The step is not yet started. Rendered with a muted style and an empty circle indicator.
- **active** -- The step is currently in progress. Rendered with a highlighted style and a pulsing indicator.
- **completed** -- The step is finished. Rendered with a success style and a checkmark indicator.

When `status` is omitted, the step renders in a neutral style without a progress indicator.

## Example

````markdown
```ui:steps
steps:
  - title: Install dependencies
    status: completed
    content: |
      Run `pnpm install` to install all packages.
  - title: Configure the project
    status: active
    content: |
      Edit `glyph.config.ts` to set up your theme and register plugins.

      You can also configure custom components in this file.
  - title: Build and deploy
    status: pending
    content: |
      Run `pnpm build` and deploy to your hosting provider.
```
````

export const stepsExample = `\`\`\`ui:steps
steps:
  - title: Install dependencies
    status: completed
    content: |
      Run pnpm install to install all packages.
  - title: Configure the project
    status: active
    content: |
      Edit glyph.config.ts to set up your theme and register plugins.

      You can also configure custom components in this file.
  - title: Build and deploy
    status: pending
    content: |
      Run pnpm build and deploy to your hosting provider.

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={stepsExample} />

## Content nesting

Like `ui:tabs`, each step's `content` field is a Markdown string that the compiler parses recursively into child `Block[]` entries in the IR.

Supported content inside steps:

- Paragraphs with inline formatting (bold, italic, code, links)
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Code blocks (indented by 4 spaces inside the YAML literal block scalar)
- Images and links

Nested `ui:` components inside step content are **not supported in v1** and are deferred to v2.

## Accessibility

- Steps render as an ordered list (`<ol>`) for semantic structure.
- Each step's `status` is communicated via `aria-current="step"` for the active step.
- Completed steps include a visually hidden "completed" label for screen readers.
- The step title is rendered as a heading element for landmark navigation.
