import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Accordion** component (`ui:accordion`) renders collapsible sections for progressive disclosure. Each section has a clickable header that expands or collapses its content. Built on native `<details>`/`<summary>` elements for maximum accessibility.

## Examples

export const defaultExample = `\`\`\`ui:accordion
title: Frequently Asked Questions
defaultOpen:
  - 0
sections:
  - title: What is GlyphJS?
    content: >
      GlyphJS is a Markdown-to-interactive-UI rendering engine.
      It compiles enhanced Markdown into React components.
  - title: How does theming work?
    content: >
      All components use CSS custom properties. Set variables
      on a wrapper element to change the theme.
  - title: Can I create custom components?
    content: >
      Yes. Create a Zod schema, a React component, and register
      it with the runtime via registerComponent().
\`\`\``;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={defaultExample} />

<details>
<summary>View Glyph Markdown source</summary>

````markdown
```ui:accordion
title: Frequently Asked Questions
defaultOpen:
  - 0
sections:
  - title: What is GlyphJS?
    content: >
      GlyphJS is a Markdown-to-interactive-UI rendering engine.
      It compiles enhanced Markdown into React components.

### Exclusive mode

When `multiple: false`, only one section can be open at a time. Opening a new section automatically closes any previously open section.

export const exclusiveExample = `\`\`\`ui:accordion
title: API Reference
multiple: false
defaultOpen:
  - 0
sections:
  - title: compile(source)
    content: >
      Compiles a Markdown string into a GlyphIR document.
      Returns a CompilationResult with ir, diagnostics, and hasErrors.
  - title: createGlyphRuntime(options)
    content: >
      Creates a runtime instance with theme and component registrations.
      Returns an object with GlyphDocument and a plugin registry.
  - title: registerComponent(definition)
    content: >
      Registers a custom component definition with the runtime.
      The definition must include type, schema, and render function.
\`\`\``;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={exclusiveExample} />

<details>
<summary>View Glyph Markdown source</summary>

</details>

### All collapsed

By default, all sections start collapsed when `defaultOpen` is omitted.

export const collapsedExample = `\`\`\`ui:accordion
sections:
  - title: Getting Started
    content: Install the packages and create a runtime instance.
  - title: Writing Markdown
    content: "Use standard Markdown with embedded ui: fenced code blocks."
  - title: Deploying
    content: Build your app and serve the static output.
\`\`\``;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={collapsedExample} />

<details>
<summary>View Glyph Markdown source</summary>

````markdown
```ui:accordion

  - title: Getting Started
    content: Install the packages and create a runtime instance.
  - title: Writing Markdown
    content: "Use standard Markdown with embedded ui: fenced code blocks."

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `string` | No | -- | Optional heading displayed above the accordion sections. |
| `sections` | `AccordionSection[]` | Yes | -- | Array of collapsible sections (at least 1). |

| `content` | `string` | Yes | Body text revealed when the section is expanded. |

## Interaction events

When `interactive: true` is set, the accordion emits an `accordion-toggle` event each time a section is expanded or collapsed.

````markdown
```ui:accordion
interactive: true
sections:
  - title: First Section
    content: Content for the first section.
  - title: Second Section
    content: Content for the second section.
```
````

**Event kind:** `accordion-toggle`

| Payload field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sectionIndex` | `number` | 0-based index of the toggled section. |
| `sectionTitle` | `string` | Title of the toggled section. |
| `expanded` | `boolean` | Whether the section is now expanded (`true`) or collapsed (`false`). |

## Accessibility

- Built on native `<details>`/`<summary>` HTML elements, providing built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- Each section header is focusable and can be toggled with Enter or Space.
- The container uses `role="region"` with `aria-label` set to the `title` (or "Accordion" if no title).
- Chevron indicators (▸/▾) are marked `aria-hidden="true"` since `<details>` already communicates expanded/collapsed state natively.
- In exclusive mode (`multiple: false`), JavaScript enforces single-open behavior while preserving native element semantics.
