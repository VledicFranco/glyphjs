title: Flowchart
description: Directed graph for decision trees and process flows with typed nodes and labeled edges.
---

import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Flowchart** component renders directed graphs for decision trees and process flows. Nodes are typed (start, end, process, decision) with distinct shapes, and edges support labels for branch conditions.

## Basic example

export const basicExample = `
\`\`\`ui:flowchart
title: Order Processing
direction: top-down
nodes:
  - id: start
    type: start
    label: Order Received
  - id: validate
    type: process
    label: Validate Payment
  - id: check
    type: decision
    label: Payment Valid?
  - id: fulfill
    type: process
    label: Fulfill Order
  - id: reject
    type: end
    label: Reject Order
  - id: done
    type: end
    label: Complete
edges:
  - from: start
    to: validate
  - from: validate
    to: check
  - from: check
    to: fulfill
    label: "Yes"
  - from: check
    to: reject
    label: "No"
  - from: fulfill
    to: done
\`\`\`
`;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={basicExample} />

## Left-to-right layout

Use `direction: left-right` for horizontal flows like CI/CD pipelines.

export const lrExample = `
\`\`\`ui:flowchart
title: CI/CD Pipeline
direction: left-right
nodes:
  - id: commit
    type: start
    label: Commit
  - id: build
    type: process
    label: Build
  - id: test
    type: process
    label: Run Tests
  - id: gate
    type: decision
    label: Tests Pass?
  - id: deploy
    type: end
    label: Deploy
  - id: fix
    type: process
    label: Fix Issues
edges:
  - from: commit
    to: build
  - from: build
    to: test
  - from: test
    to: gate
  - from: gate
    to: deploy
    label: "Yes"
  - from: gate
    to: fix
    label: "No"
  - from: fix
    to: build
\`\`\`
`;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={lrExample} />

## Complex branching

Multiple decision nodes create rich branching logic.

export const branchExample = `
\`\`\`ui:flowchart
title: Error Handling
direction: top-down
nodes:
  - id: start
    type: start
    label: Request Received
  - id: auth
    type: decision
    label: Authenticated?
  - id: valid
    type: decision
    label: Input Valid?
  - id: process
    type: process
    label: Process Request
  - id: err401
    type: end
    label: 401 Unauthorized
  - id: err400
    type: end
    label: 400 Bad Request
  - id: ok
    type: end
    label: 200 OK
edges:
  - from: start
    to: auth
  - from: auth
    to: err401
    label: "No"
  - from: auth
    to: valid
    label: "Yes"
  - from: valid
    to: err400
    label: "No"
  - from: valid
    to: process
    label: "Yes"
  - from: process
    to: ok
\`\`\`
`;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={branchExample} />

| `nodes`     | `FlowchartNode[]`           | *(required)* | Array of nodes (min 2)                 |
| `edges`     | `FlowchartEdge[]`           | *(required)* | Array of directed edges (min 1)        |
| `direction` | `'top-down' \| 'left-right'` | `'top-down'` | Layout direction                       |
| `interactionMode` | `'modifier-key' \| 'click-to-activate' \| 'always'` | `'modifier-key'` | Controls zoom/pan behavior |

### FlowchartNode

| Property | Type                                       | Default     | Description        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------ |
| `id`     | `string`                                   | *(required)* | Unique identifier  |
| `type`   | `'start' \| 'end' \| 'process' \| 'decision'` | `'process'` | Node shape type    |
| `label`  | `string`                                   | *(required)* | Display label      |

### FlowchartEdge

| Property | Type     | Default      | Description                  |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `from`   | `string` | *(required)* | Source node ID               |
| `to`     | `string` | *(required)* | Target node ID               |
| `label`  | `string` | —            | Optional label (e.g. Yes/No) |

### Node shapes

- **start / end** — Rounded rectangle (stadium shape) with accent coloring
- **process** — Standard rectangle with surface coloring
- **decision** — Diamond shape with accent border

## Interaction Modes

The flowchart supports three interaction modes for zooming and panning:

- **`modifier-key` (default):** Hold Ctrl/Cmd while scrolling to zoom. Best for scrollable content.
- **`click-to-activate`:** Click once to activate zoom/pan, Escape to deactivate. Best for explicit opt-in.
- **`always`:** Scroll immediately zooms with no modifier required. Legacy behavior.

See the [Graph component documentation](/components/graph/#interaction-modes) for detailed examples and use cases.

## Accessibility

- SVG has `role="img"` with an `aria-label` describing the flowchart title and node/edge counts.
- A hidden data table lists all nodes, their types, and connections for screen reader users.
- Edge labels are included in the accessible table as relationship descriptions.
