title: Tabs
description: Organize content into switchable tabbed panels.
---

import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Tabs** component (`ui:tabs`) organizes content into multiple switchable panels, each identified by a label. Only one tab panel is visible at a time. Tabs are a **container component** -- each tab's `content` field contains Markdown that the compiler re-parses recursively into child blocks.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tabs` | `Tab[]` | Yes | -- | An array of tab objects. Must contain at least one tab. |

### Tab object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | `string` | Yes | -- | The text shown on the tab button. |
| `content` | `string` | Yes | -- | Markdown content rendered inside the tab panel. Parsed recursively by the compiler. |

## Example

````markdown
```ui:tabs
tabs:
  - label: Overview
    content: |
      This is the **overview** tab with standard Markdown.

      It can contain multiple paragraphs and inline formatting.
  - label: Installation
    content: |
      Run the following command to install:

      - `pnpm add @glyphjs/runtime`
      - `pnpm add @glyphjs/schemas`
  - label: Configuration
    content: |
      Edit `glyph.config.ts` to set up your theme and plugins.
```
````

export const tabsExample = `\`\`\`ui:tabs
tabs:
  - label: Overview
    content: |
      This is the **overview** tab with standard Markdown.

      It can contain multiple paragraphs and inline formatting.
  - label: Installation
    content: |
      Run the following command to install:

      - \\\`pnpm add @glyphjs/runtime\\\`
      - \\\`pnpm add @glyphjs/schemas\\\`
  - label: Configuration
    content: |
      Edit \\\`glyph.config.ts\\\` to set up your theme and plugins.
\`\`\``;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={tabsExample} />

## Content nesting

Since Markdown fenced blocks cannot nest, tab children are expressed as Markdown strings inside the YAML `content` fields. The compiler parses each `content` field recursively, producing child `Block[]` entries in the IR.

Supported content inside tabs:

- Paragraphs with inline formatting (bold, italic, code, links)
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Code blocks (indented by 4 spaces inside the YAML literal block scalar)
- Images and links

Nested `ui:` components inside tab content are **not supported in v1** and are deferred to v2.

## Accessibility

- Tabs implement the WAI-ARIA Tabs pattern (`role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`).
- Arrow keys navigate between tab buttons; Enter/Space activates a tab.
- The active tab button receives `aria-selected="true"` and its panel receives focus on activation.
- Tab panels are associated with their tab buttons via `aria-labelledby` and `aria-controls` attributes.
