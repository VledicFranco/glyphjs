The **Relation** component (`ui:relation`) renders entity-relationship (ER) diagrams with entities, typed attributes, and cardinality-annotated relationships. It builds on the same graph abstraction as `ui:graph` but constrains the model for database and domain modeling use cases.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `entities` | `Entity[]` | Yes | -- | An array of entity objects to render as ER diagram boxes. |
| `relationships` | `Relationship[]` | Yes | -- | An array of relationship objects connecting entities. |
| `layout` | `"top-down" \| "left-right"` | No | -- | Layout direction for the diagram. |

### Entity object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | -- | Unique identifier for the entity. Referenced by relationships. |
| `label` | `string` | Yes | -- | Display name shown in the entity header. |
| `attributes` | `Attribute[]` | No | -- | An array of typed attributes displayed inside the entity box. |

### Attribute object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | -- | The attribute name (e.g. column name). |
| `type` | `string` | Yes | -- | The data type (e.g. "uuid", "varchar", "integer", "timestamp"). |
| `primaryKey` | `boolean` | No | -- | Whether this attribute is part of the primary key. Shown with a key icon. |

### Relationship object

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `from` | `string` | Yes | -- | The `id` of the source entity. |
| `to` | `string` | Yes | -- | The `id` of the target entity. |
| `label` | `string` | No | -- | Text displayed on the relationship line. |
| `cardinality` | `"1:1" \| "1:N" \| "N:1" \| "N:M"` | Yes | -- | The cardinality of the relationship, rendered with crow's foot notation. |

## Cardinality notation

Relationships are drawn with crow's foot notation:

| Cardinality | Meaning | Notation |
|---|---|---|
| `1:1` | One-to-one | Single line on both ends |
| `1:N` | One-to-many | Single line on source, crow's foot on target |
| `N:1` | Many-to-one | Crow's foot on source, single line on target |
| `N:M` | Many-to-many | Crow's foot on both ends |

```ui:relation
entities:
  - id: users
    label: Users
    attributes:
      - name: id
        type: uuid
        primaryKey: true
      - name: email
        type: varchar
      - name: created_at
        type: timestamp
  - id: posts
    label: Posts
    attributes:
      - name: id
        type: uuid
        primaryKey: true
      - name: title
        type: varchar
      - name: body
        type: text
      - name: author_id
        type: uuid
  - id: comments
    label: Comments
    attributes:
      - name: id
        type: uuid
        primaryKey: true
      - name: body
        type: text
      - name: post_id
        type: uuid
      - name: user_id
        type: uuid
relationships:
  - from: users
    to: posts
    label: authors
    cardinality: "1:N"
  - from: posts
    to: comments
    label: has
    cardinality: "1:N"
  - from: users
    to: comments
    label: writes
    cardinality: "1:N"
layout: left-right

## Shared abstraction with Graph

The Relation component shares a unified relational abstraction with [Graph](/components/graph/). While `ui:graph` is general-purpose, `ui:relation` constrains the model by:

- Requiring `cardinality` on every relationship (edge).
- Treating nodes as entities with typed `attributes`.
- Rendering entities as ER-diagram boxes rather than simple graph nodes.

## Accessibility

- The ER diagram is rendered inside an SVG with `role="img"` and a descriptive `aria-label`.
- Each entity box is focusable and exposes its label and attribute list through `aria-label`.
- Relationship cardinalities are described in a visually hidden text summary for screen readers.
- Primary key attributes are marked with both a visual key icon and a screen-reader-accessible label.
