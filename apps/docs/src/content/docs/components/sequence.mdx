import GlyphPreview from '../../../components/GlyphPreview.tsx';

The **Sequence Diagram** component renders UML-style interaction diagrams with actors, lifelines, and typed message arrows.

## Basic example

export const basicExample = `
\`\`\`ui:sequence
title: Authentication Flow
actors:
  - id: client
    label: Browser
  - id: api
    label: Auth API
  - id: db
    label: Database
messages:
  - from: client
    to: api
    label: POST /login
  - from: api
    to: db
    label: Query user
  - from: db
    to: api
    label: User record
    type: reply
  - from: api
    to: api
    label: Verify password
    type: self
  - from: api
    to: client
    label: JWT token
    type: reply
\`\`\`
`;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={basicExample} />

## Simple request-response

A minimal two-actor sequence.

export const simpleExample = `
\`\`\`ui:sequence
title: API Call
actors:
  - id: client
    label: Client
  - id: server
    label: Server
messages:
  - from: client
    to: server
    label: GET /users
  - from: server
    to: client
    label: "200 [{ id: 1 }]"
    type: reply
\`\`\`
`;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={simpleExample} />

## Multi-service interaction

Sequence diagrams excel at showing how messages flow across multiple services.

export const multiExample = `
\`\`\`ui:sequence
title: Order Processing
actors:
  - id: user
    label: Customer
  - id: cart
    label: Cart Service
  - id: pay
    label: Payment
  - id: inv
    label: Inventory
messages:
  - from: user
    to: cart
    label: Add to cart
  - from: cart
    to: inv
    label: Check stock
  - from: inv
    to: cart
    label: Available
    type: reply
  - from: user
    to: cart
    label: Checkout
  - from: cart
    to: pay
    label: Charge card
  - from: pay
    to: cart
    label: Success
    type: reply
  - from: cart
    to: user
    label: Order confirmed
    type: reply
\`\`\`
`;

<GlyphPreview client:only="react" source={multiExample} />

## Properties

| Property   | Type             | Default      | Description                   |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `title`    | `string`         | —            | Optional diagram title        |
| `actors`   | `Actor[]`        | *(required)* | Participants (min 2)          |
| `messages` | `Message[]`      | *(required)* | Messages in order (min 1)     |

### Actor

| Property | Type     | Default      | Description       |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| `id`     | `string` | *(required)* | Unique identifier |
| `label`  | `string` | *(required)* | Display name      |

### Message

| Property | Type                                | Default     | Description               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `from`   | `string`                            | *(required)* | Source actor ID           |
| `to`     | `string`                            | *(required)* | Target actor ID           |

### Message types

- **message** — solid arrow (standard request/call)
- **reply** — dashed arrow (response/return)
- **self** — loop arrow back to the same actor (internal processing)

## Accessibility

- SVG has `role="img"` with an `aria-label` describing the title, actor count, and message count.
- A hidden data table lists all messages in temporal order with from, to, label, and type columns.
