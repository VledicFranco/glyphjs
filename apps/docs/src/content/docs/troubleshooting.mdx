## Common Issues

### Component not rendering

**Symptom:** A `ui:*` block shows as a gray fallback box instead of the expected component.

**Cause:** The component definition was not registered with the runtime.

**Fix:** Pass all component definitions when creating the runtime:
```typescript
import { createGlyphRuntime } from '@glyphjs/runtime';
import { calloutDefinition, tabsDefinition, ... } from '@glyphjs/components';

const runtime = createGlyphRuntime({
  components: [calloutDefinition, tabsDefinition, ...],
});
```

### YAML parse error in ui block

**Symptom:** Compilation diagnostic: `Failed to parse YAML payload`.

**Cause:** The YAML inside a `ui:*` fenced block has a syntax error (wrong indentation, missing colon, etc.).

**Fix:** Check the YAML syntax. All `ui:*` blocks use YAML for their data payload. Use 2-space indentation consistently.

### Schema validation error

**Symptom:** Compilation diagnostic: `Schema validation failed for block type ui:chart`.

**Cause:** The YAML data doesn't match the component's expected schema.

**Fix:** Check the component's documentation page for the required fields. Common issues:
- Missing required fields (e.g., `type` for chart, `entities` for relation)
- Wrong data types (e.g., string where number is expected)
- Invalid enum values (e.g., `type: pie` when only `line | bar | area | ohlc` are supported)

### Timeline dates showing as "Jan 1, 1970"

**Symptom:** Timeline events are all clustered at the left side, dates show epoch.

**Cause:** Date strings that can't be parsed. The timeline supports:
- ISO dates: `2026-01-15`
- Year-month: `2026-01`
- Quarter format: `Q1 2026` or `2026-Q1`

**Fix:** Use one of the supported date formats.

### Browser crypto error

**Symptom:** `crypto.createHash is not a function` in the browser.

**Cause:** The `@glyphjs/ir` package uses Node.js crypto for content-addressed IDs. In browsers, you need a shim.

**Fix:** Add a Vite alias for `crypto` and `node:crypto` pointing to the `shared/crypto-shim.ts` file.

### Build error: Cannot find name 'process'

**Symptom:** TypeScript error when building the runtime package.

**Cause:** The runtime uses `process.env.NODE_ENV` checks but doesn't depend on `@types/node`.

**Fix:** This has been resolved. The runtime now uses a `typeof` guard that works in all environments.

## Debugging Tips

- Check `result.diagnostics` after calling `compile()` — it contains all warnings and errors
- Set `result.hasErrors` to see if any error-level diagnostics were produced
- In development mode, the runtime logs schema validation warnings to the console
- Use the Playground (`/playground`) to test markdown interactively
- The Diagnostics Overlay can be toggled with Escape key in development mode
